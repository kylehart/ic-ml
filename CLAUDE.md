## Recent Achievements (September-October 2025)

### ✅ Post-Processing Slug Validation (NEW - October 2025)
- **Architecture**: Separation of concerns - LLM for semantic understanding, code for validation
- **Success Rate**: 100% valid slugs in final output (was 2.8% error rate)
- **Simplified LLM Task**: LLM outputs single `best_slug` instead of `category_slug,subcategory_slug`
- **Automatic Hierarchy Resolution**: Post-processing determines if slug is primary/subcategory and adds parent automatically
- **Auto-Correction**: Fuzzy matching + title-to-slug mapping corrects ~2% of LLM hallucinations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all corrections in `validation_report.json`
- **Methods**:
  - Hierarchical mapping: subcategory → auto-add parent category
  - Title-to-slug mapping for common conversions
  - Fuzzy matching with 80% threshold
  - Invalid slugs cleared rather than guessed

### ✅ Working Product URLs
- **Algorithm**: 100% success rate on tested URLs (6/6 products work)
- **Catalog Enhancement**: Added slug field to all 787 products
- **URL Pattern**: `https://rogueherbalist.com/product/{generated-slug}/`
- **Examples**: `hemp-adapt-2oz`, `four-mushroom-immune-complex-2oz`

### ✅ HTML Report Generation
- **Package**: `markdown` with extensions (extra, codehilite, toc, nl2br)
- **Styling**: Professional CSS with responsive design
- **Links**: Clickable product purchase links in HTML output
- **Formats**: Both `.md` and `.html` generated automatically

### ✅ End-to-End Customer Journey
- Health concern input → LLM processing → Product recommendations → **Working purchase URLs**
- Complete journey from health quiz to Rogue Herbalist product pages
- Cost: $0.0003 per interaction with 5 product recommendations

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **IMPORTANT**: Always use experimental run framework for LLM experiments
- **MUST**: Include client tracking metadata in all LLM calls (automatic via LLMClient)
- Use absolute paths for file operations
- Follow existing patterns in `run_health_quiz.py` for new use cases

### Validation Architecture (NEW - October 2025)
- **Principle**: LLMs for semantic understanding, code for deterministic validation
- **Pattern**: Always save raw LLM output + corrected output + validation report
- **When to use post-processing**: Whenever LLM output must match exact values (slugs, IDs, codes)
- **LLM Task Simplification**: Ask LLM for single best match, let code handle structural requirements (hierarchy, parents)
- **Example**: See `validate_and_correct_slugs()` in `run_assign_cat.py:239-507`

### Known Issues
- **Multi-Assignment**: 1.2% of products get duplicate category assignments (9/761 products)
  - 5 products: Exact duplicates (bug)
  - 2 products: Same category with/without subcategory (bug)
  - 2 products: Different categories (possibly intentional)
  - See TODO.md for refactoring plan

### Cost Management
- All LLM calls automatically tagged with client, use_case, project, environment
- Health Quiz: ~$0.0003 per interaction (5x cheaper than classification)
- Product Classification: ~$0.0015 per product
- Use `get_cost_breakdown_for_reporting()` for billing data

### Testing Workflow

**Automated Unit Tests** (122 tests, 100% passing):
```bash
# Run all tests (excluding web_service which needs FastAPI installed)
python3 -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_web_service.py -v

# Run specific test file
python3 -m pytest tests/test_product_recommendation_engine.py -v

# Run with coverage report
python3 -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_web_service.py --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

**Integration Testing**:
1. Test with single personas first: `--persona "Sarah Chen"`
2. Compare models for cost optimization
3. Use reanalysis tools for iterative development
4. Check `runs/*/outputs/health_quiz_report.html` for styled reports with clickable links

### Updating Product Catalog
When updating the product catalog from WooCommerce:
1. Export products from WooCommerce admin (Products > All Products > Export)
2. WooCommerce export includes all necessary fields including product slugs
3. Run `python3 transform_catalog.py` to clean newlines and format for use
4. The catalog now includes real WooCommerce slugs (no generation needed)

## Configuration (CURRENT)

### Models (config/models.yaml)
- **Default**: gpt-4o-mini (cost-optimized for both use cases)
- **Health Quiz**: Configured with consultation threshold, URL patterns
- **Client Tracking**: Automatic via LiteLLM metadata integration

### Use Case Settings
```yaml
health_quiz:
  default_model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

```

## Unix Tool Environment Gaps

**Purpose**: Track Unix commands that Claude attempts to use but are not installed on this system. These should be installed to improve Claude's effectiveness.

**Missing Tools Discovered**:
- `tree` - Directory structure visualization (attempted: 2025-10-22)
  - Install: `brew install tree` (macOS)
  - Use case: Better directory structure display in exploration
  - Priority: Low (nice-to-have for documentation)

**Previously Missing (Now Available)**:
- `uvicorn` - ASGI server for FastAPI
  - Status: Installed via pip in Python environment
  - Use case: Running web_service.py locally

**Installation Notes**:
- Add new discoveries to this list with date attempted
- Mark priority: High (blocks work), Medium (frequent use), Low (convenience)
- Note installation method when resolved
- Move to "Previously Missing" section once installed

## Current Development State
- **Health Quiz**: PRODUCTION READY - working end-to-end with real testing
- **Product Classification**: PRODUCTION - 100% valid slug output with auto-correction
- **Taxonomy Generation**: PRODUCTION - 87-element taxonomy with SEO metadata
- **Web Service**: Architectural design complete, needs deployment redesign
- **Multi-Client**: Framework ready, tested with rogue_herbalist config

## Important Files to Monitor

**Cost & Billing:**
- `runs/*/outputs/client_cost_breakdown.json` - Billing-ready cost attribution

**Classification Quality:**
- `runs/assign-cat-*/outputs/classifications.csv` - Final validated output (100% valid)
- `runs/assign-cat-*/outputs/validation_report.json` - Auto-correction audit trail
- `runs/assign-cat-*/outputs/classification_report.md` - Analysis and distribution

**Configuration & Data:**
- `config/models.yaml` - Use case configuration
- `data/rogue-herbalist/latest-best-taxonomy.xml` - Current taxonomy (87 slugs)
- `data/health-quiz-samples/user_personas.json` - Test scenarios
