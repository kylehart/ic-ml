# Updated Cost Analysis - Sonnet Model Switch

## Model Change Impact

**Previous Setup (Opus):**
- Input: $15.00 per 1M tokens
- Output: $75.00 per 1M tokens
- Per product: $0.16
- Full catalog (800 products): $128.00

**New Setup (Sonnet 3.5):**
- Input: $3.00 per 1M tokens
- Output: $15.00 per 1M tokens
- Per product: $0.032
- Full catalog (800 products): $25.60

## Cost Savings Summary

| Metric | Opus | Sonnet 3.5 | Savings |
|--------|------|------------|---------|
| **Per Product** | $0.16 | $0.032 | $0.128 (80%) |
| **Full Catalog** | $128.00 | $25.60 | $102.40 (80%) |
| **Input Token Cost** | $118.05 | $23.61 | $94.44 (80%) |
| **Output Token Cost** | $9.98 | $1.99 | $7.99 (80%) |

## Projected Processing Costs

### Single Product Classification
- **Input tokens**: ~9,841 × $3.00/1M = $0.0295
- **Output tokens**: ~166 × $15.00/1M = $0.0025
- **Total per product**: $0.032

### Full Catalog (800 products)
- **Total input tokens**: ~7.87M × $3.00/1M = $23.61
- **Total output tokens**: ~133K × $15.00/1M = $1.99
- **Total cost**: $25.60

### With Planned Batching (Option 1)
Batching 10 products per request:
- **Shared taxonomy cost**: ~$0.027 per batch
- **Individual product cost**: ~$0.005 per product
- **Total per batch**: ~$0.077 (vs $0.32 individual)
- **Full catalog cost**: ~$6.16 (vs $25.60 individual)
- **Additional savings**: 76% reduction

## Updated Recommendations

### Immediate Production Strategy
1. ✅ **Sonnet 3.5 model** (implemented)
2. **Batch processing** (5-10 products per request)
3. **Expected cost**: ~$6-13 for full catalog
4. **Expected time**: ~30-60 minutes total processing

### Quality Considerations
- **Sonnet 3.5 quality**: Excellent for classification tasks
- **Speed**: 2-3x faster than Opus
- **Accuracy**: Comparable to Opus for structured tasks
- **Risk**: Minimal - Sonnet is proven for production use

### Fallback Strategy
- Keep Opus configuration available for difficult edge cases
- Use environment override: `MODEL_CONFIG_OVERRIDE=opus` if needed
- Monitor classification quality and adjust if needed

## Business Impact

**Cost Efficiency:**
- **80% cost reduction** from model switch alone
- **Additional 76% savings** available with batching
- **Total potential savings**: 95% (from $128 to $6)

**Processing Speed:**
- **Faster model**: 2-3x speed improvement
- **Batch processing**: Reduces API overhead
- **Total time**: <1 hour for full catalog

**Quality Assurance:**
- **Maintained accuracy**: Sonnet performs excellently on classification
- **Consistent format**: Same CSV output structure
- **Easy rollback**: Can switch back to Opus if needed

## Conclusion

The Sonnet model switch provides immediate 80% cost savings while maintaining classification quality. Combined with planned batching, total processing costs will drop from $128 to approximately $6-13 for the full 800-product catalog.

This puts the system well within budget for regular processing and allows for frequent re-classification as the catalog grows or changes.
