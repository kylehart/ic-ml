Add a third primary category for "Stress & Mood Support" with appropriate subcategories.

The new category should include:
- A sub-title that fits the pattern of existing categories
- A description of stress and mood support products
- Meta information with relevant chebi-roles (e.g., anxiolytic, adaptogen)
- At least two subcategories related to stress relief and mood balance

Maintain all existing categories unchanged. Follow the same XML structure and formatting patterns as the source taxonomy.
