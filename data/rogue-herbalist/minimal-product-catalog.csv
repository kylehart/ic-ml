Inside each bottle youâll find vitamins A, C and K, along with minerals and nutrients such as copper, manganese and potassium.

But thatâs just the surface level of what makes this concentrate great. Inside each bottle youâll find vitamins A, C and K, along with minerals and nutrients such as copper, manganese and potassium. And if you need to chill out, tart cherries can help you dial it down a notch thanks to naturally-occurring melatonin, and the compounds tryptophan and anthocyanins, which encourage your body to create melatonin. Tart cherries also offer five times the antioxidants of sweet cherries, but our concentrate takes that antioxidant profile even further by packing the antioxidant power of 1000* tart cherries in each 32-oz bottle. Thatâs a lot of goodness loaded into one concentrate! Traditionally used for relief from inflammation and gout. \n \n \n \nUntainted by sweeteners, preservatives, and other additives, Dynamic Health Certified Organic Tart Cherry Juice is nothing more than pure, natural power and nutrition. Extracted from sun-ripened montmorency and balaton tart cherries, our 100% juice concentrate contains the antioxidant power of 1000* tart cherries in each 32-oz bottle along with naturally occurring nutrients. \n \n \n \nPerfectly tasty on its own or mixed with seltzer, smoothies, sauces, dressings, and vinaigrettes, it's easy to take a serving each day.

In clinical studies, a special form of vitamin K2 called menaquinone-4 (or just MK-4 for short) has been shown to support the biological processes that help maintain bone mineral density in populations that need it most, such as postmenopausal women. \n \n<div id=""details"" class=""navigationAnchorTitle navigation-anchor-title""> \n \n<h2 class=""section-header"">Product Details</h2> \n \n</div> \n \n<div class=""productDetails product-details mb-3 mb-md-4""> \n \n \n \n<strong>Calcium</strong> \n \n \n \nBone Restore provides a total of 700 mg of four types of easily absorbed calcium: calcium carbonate, calcium citrate malate, calcium bisglycinate chelate, and calcium fructoborateâall delivered in a capsule designed to facilitate calcium breakdown during digestion. \n \n<div id=""detailsCollapse"" class=""collapse"" aria-hidden=""false"" aria-expanded=""true""> \n \n \n \n<strong>Vitamin D3</strong> \n \n \n \nVitamin D is essential for absorbing calcium from the digestive tract into the bloodstream, thus it is vital for helping maintain strong, healthy bones and teeth.<sup>1,2</sup> \n \n \n \n<strong>Vitamin K is necessary for healthy bone mineral density</strong> \n \n \n \nBone loss occurs over time and is a result of an imbalance in the activity of bone cells where there is an increased activity in the bone-dissolving cells called osteoclasts as well as a corresponding decrease in the activity of bone-forming cells, or osteoblasts.<sup>3</sup> \n \n \n \nVitamin K has been shown to be essential for bone mineralization because itâs a cofactor for the carboxylation of osteocalcin, a protein produced by osteoblasts that is responsible for binding calcium and depositing in the bone. This process is calledÂ <em>bone mineralization</em>.<sup>4,5</sup> \n \n \n \n<strong>Getting enough vitamin K2</strong> \n \n \n \nIf youâre not getting enough vitamin K2, osteocalcin doesnât undergo carboxylation and remains in its inactive form, which means it cannot bind to calcium and play its role in bone formation.<sup>5</sup> \n \n \n \n<strong>Magnesium</strong> \n \n \n \nMagnesium is needed to maintain strong bones and a healthy vascular system.<sup>6</sup>Â Bone Restore contains 300 mg of magnesium from magnesium oxide. \n \n \n \n<strong>Other bone healthy nutrients</strong> \n \n \n \nLike other formulas in our Bone Restore family, Bone Restore Elite also delivers healthy doses of the trace minerals your bones need: \n \n \n \n<strong>Zinc, manganese and silicon</strong>Â are essential for healthy bone maintenance. Bone maintenance is the healthy balance between bone mineral resorption and remodeling.<sup>7-10</sup>Â You have to have sufficient intake of these elements to support healthy bone formation. \n \n \n \n<strong>Boron</strong>Â is a trace mineral with beneficial effects for bone and joint strength.<sup>9,11</sup>Â This formula contains patented Fruitex BÂ® OsteoBoronÂ®, made from a novel calcium/carbohydrate/boron complex. \n \n \n \n</div> \n \n</div> \n \n<div id=""supplementfacts"" class=""navigationAnchorTitle navigation-anchor-title""> \n \n<h2 class=""section-header"">Supplement Facts</h2> \n \n</div> \n \n<div class=""productSupplementFacts product-supplement-facts mb-2""> \n \n<div id=""tabs-supplement_facts""> \n \n<table> \n \n<tbody> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td> \n \n<table class=""wwwProdLDTableIngredients"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0""> \n \n<tbody> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td colspan=""2"">Serving Size 4 capsules</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td colspan=""2"">Servings Per Container 30</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellAmountPerServing"" colspan=""2""><span class=""wwwProdLDTextAmountPerServing"">Amount Per Serving</span></td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Vitamin D3 [as cholecalciferol (1000 IU)]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"" width=""20%"">25 mcg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Vitamin K2 [as menaquinone-4 (45 mg)]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">45,000 mcg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Calcium [as carbonate, citrate malate, bisglycinate chelate, fructoborate]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">700 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Magnesium [as magnesium oxide]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">300 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Zinc [as zinc amino acid chelate]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">2 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Manganese [as manganese amino acid chelate]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">1 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Silicon [from horsetail extract (herb), silicon dioxide]]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">5 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Boron [as patented Fruitex BÂ® OsteoBoronÂ® calcium fructoborate]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">3 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellOtherIngredients"" colspan=""2"">Other ingredients: vegetable cellulose (capsule), stearic acid, maltodextrin, ascorbyl palmitate, silica, rice flour, food starch-modified, citric acid.</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n</tbody> \n \n</table> \n \n<p class=""small"">Fruitex BÂ® and OsteoBoronÂ® are registered trademarks of VDF Futureceuticals, Inc.

However, we now know the health risks of eating too much salt, so health-conscious people may miss out on an easy source of iodine. Vitamins D and K with Sea-Iodineâ¢ delivers 1,000 mcg of iodine to support healthy iodine levels. \n \n \n \n<strong>Vitamin K1 and two different types of K2</strong> \n \n \n \nVitamin K helps inhibit calcium buildup in your arteries while promoting healthy calcium absorption into your bone matrix.<sup>3</sup>Â K1 is the most common form of vitamin K in the diet, coming primarily from leafy green vegetablesâthough vitamin K1 isnât well absorbed from these foods. \n \n \n \nVitamin K2 is found in cheese, eggs and fermented soybeans. It has been shown to be more bioavailable than K1 and to remain active in the body far longer. The MK-4 and MK-7 forms of vitamin K2 also provide important benefits but have different tissue distributions and bioavailability, so itâs important to take both.<sup>4,5</sup>Â This formula contains both forms of vitamin K2. \n \n \n \n<strong>Vitamin D3 for cognitive, bone and immune health</strong> \n \n \n \nHealthy serum vitamin D levels have been shown to correspond with better cognitive function.<sup>6,7</sup>Â Vitamin D, along with vitamin K and essential minerals, is necessary for facilitating the transport of calcium into the bone matrix for strong, healthy bones and teeth.<sup>8</sup>Â Vitamin D also plays a critical role in healthy immune function.<sup>9</sup> \n \n \n \nSome people may need 125 mcg (5,000 IU) to 200 mcg (8,000 IU) of vitamin D3 a day to achieve healthy blood levels of vitamin D. If your multivitamin already delivers 25-75 mcg (1,000â3,000 IU) of vitamin D, adding Vitamins D and K with Sea-Iodineâ¢ may help achieve healthy vitamin D levels. \n \n \n \n<strong>Vitamin D3 for heart health and blood pressure support</strong> \n \n \n \nVitamin D promotes a healthy inflammatory response, supports cardiovascular health and encourages healthy endothelial function. Vitamin D also helps inhibit excess renin levels.
