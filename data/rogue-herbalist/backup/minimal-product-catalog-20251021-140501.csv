Should be used in place of opium and quinine. It will cure intermittent and remittent fevers. Oh, why will not people use this wonderful remedy in place of poisonous drugs? It is efficient and harmless. A teaspoonful of fit root and fennel seed, steeped in a pint of boiling water for twenty minutes, is an excellent douche for inflammation of the vagina and uterus, also good used as a wash for sore eyes.

Many people prefer using tryptophan combined with its essential cofactors lysine and niacinamide in lieu of 5-HTP. Tryptophan is better able to remain stable in the blood and cross the blood-brain barrier, where it is converted to serotonin. If 5-HTP converts to serotonin in the blood, this serotonin will not cross the blood-brain barrier.

Not only does it make an <a href=""https://rogueherbalist.com/product/jiaogulan-organic-1oz-bag/"">amazing tea</a>, but this tincture is sweet, delicious, energizing, focusing, and enriches your vitality. We source the highest quality organic Jiaogulan from Northern Thailand and tincture at a 1:3 strength in organic cane alcohol and reverse osmosis maple water. The research on Jiaogulan is remarkable and I encourage everyone to learn more about this amazing adaptogen. Jiaogulan is a powerful adaptogenic tea from the small farming communities in Northern Thailand. It is in the Ginseng family and has a very similar sweet taste.

These alkaloids are more potent in the roots, but are also present in Comfrey Leaf. While some studies have suggested that the PAs in comfrey may be harmful, others have found that the herb is safe when used in small amounts and for short periods of time. While it is recommended that Comfrey only be used topically, this is a matter of great debate among herbalists. The dried herb can be used in poultices for sore muscles, broken bones, stiff joints, and other musculoskeletal complaints. We also have a <a href=""https://rogueherbalist.com/product/comfrey-extract-1oz-topical/"">Comfrey Liniment</a> for topical use. \n \n \n \nSold in 1oz. quantities. If you want multiple ounces, just add multiple quantities. \n \n \n \nWe plant Comfrey in our herb garden around the edges of the porch and building. It is a wonderful plant in permaculture as it helps to pull up minerals from the soil and then the leaves can be used as a “green manure”. They provide a beautiful ground cover as well as nourishment for the pollinators.

It is the third most prevalent element in the body after Calcium. Along with Chloride, Sodium, Magnesium and Calcium, Potassium is an essential electrolyte. These elements are called electrolytes because they carry an electrical charge when dissolved in body fluids. Electrolytes help regulate nerve transmission and many cell membrane functions. Magnesium helps maintain the Potassium in the cells; but even more crucial is the proper Sodium to Potassium balance. Without Potassium, cell function will be impacted. Potassium works with Sodium to regulate blood pressure, transmit nerve impulses, and maintain cellular wall permeability. Along with Magnesium, it is essential for the proper functioning of the heart muscle. In this role, Potassium acts as the catalyst stimulating cellular contraction.

In clinical studies, a special form of vitamin K2 called menaquinone-4 (or just MK-4 for short) has been shown to support the biological processes that help maintain bone mineral density in populations that need it most, such as postmenopausal women. \n \n<div id=""details"" class=""navigationAnchorTitle navigation-anchor-title""> \n \n<h2 class=""section-header"">Product Details</h2> \n \n</div> \n \n<div class=""productDetails product-details mb-3 mb-md-4""> \n \n \n \n<strong>Calcium</strong> \n \n \n \nBone Restore provides a total of 700 mg of four types of easily absorbed calcium: calcium carbonate, calcium citrate malate, calcium bisglycinate chelate, and calcium fructoborate—all delivered in a capsule designed to facilitate calcium breakdown during digestion. \n \n<div id=""detailsCollapse"" class=""collapse"" aria-hidden=""false"" aria-expanded=""true""> \n \n \n \n<strong>Vitamin D3</strong> \n \n \n \nVitamin D is essential for absorbing calcium from the digestive tract into the bloodstream, thus it is vital for helping maintain strong, healthy bones and teeth.<sup>1,2</sup> \n \n \n \n<strong>Vitamin K is necessary for healthy bone mineral density</strong> \n \n \n \nBone loss occurs over time and is a result of an imbalance in the activity of bone cells where there is an increased activity in the bone-dissolving cells called osteoclasts as well as a corresponding decrease in the activity of bone-forming cells, or osteoblasts.<sup>3</sup> \n \n \n \nVitamin K has been shown to be essential for bone mineralization because it’s a cofactor for the carboxylation of osteocalcin, a protein produced by osteoblasts that is responsible for binding calcium and depositing in the bone. This process is called <em>bone mineralization</em>.<sup>4,5</sup> \n \n \n \n<strong>Getting enough vitamin K2</strong> \n \n \n \nIf you’re not getting enough vitamin K2, osteocalcin doesn’t undergo carboxylation and remains in its inactive form, which means it cannot bind to calcium and play its role in bone formation.<sup>5</sup> \n \n \n \n<strong>Magnesium</strong> \n \n \n \nMagnesium is needed to maintain strong bones and a healthy vascular system.<sup>6</sup> Bone Restore contains 300 mg of magnesium from magnesium oxide. \n \n \n \n<strong>Other bone healthy nutrients</strong> \n \n \n \nLike other formulas in our Bone Restore family, Bone Restore Elite also delivers healthy doses of the trace minerals your bones need: \n \n \n \n<strong>Zinc, manganese and silicon</strong> are essential for healthy bone maintenance. Bone maintenance is the healthy balance between bone mineral resorption and remodeling.<sup>7-10</sup> You have to have sufficient intake of these elements to support healthy bone formation. \n \n \n \n<strong>Boron</strong> is a trace mineral with beneficial effects for bone and joint strength.<sup>9,11</sup> This formula contains patented Fruitex B® OsteoBoron®, made from a novel calcium/carbohydrate/boron complex. \n \n \n \n</div> \n \n</div> \n \n<div id=""supplementfacts"" class=""navigationAnchorTitle navigation-anchor-title""> \n \n<h2 class=""section-header"">Supplement Facts</h2> \n \n</div> \n \n<div class=""productSupplementFacts product-supplement-facts mb-2""> \n \n<div id=""tabs-supplement_facts""> \n \n<table> \n \n<tbody> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td> \n \n<table class=""wwwProdLDTableIngredients"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0""> \n \n<tbody> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td colspan=""2"">Serving Size 4 capsules</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td colspan=""2"">Servings Per Container 30</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellAmountPerServing"" colspan=""2""><span class=""wwwProdLDTextAmountPerServing"">Amount Per Serving</span></td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Vitamin D3 [as cholecalciferol (1000 IU)]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"" width=""20%"">25 mcg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Vitamin K2 [as menaquinone-4 (45 mg)]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">45,000 mcg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Calcium [as carbonate, citrate malate, bisglycinate chelate, fructoborate]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">700 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Magnesium [as magnesium oxide]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">300 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Zinc [as zinc amino acid chelate]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">2 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Manganese [as manganese amino acid chelate]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">1 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Silicon [from horsetail extract (herb), silicon dioxide]]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">5 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Boron [as patented Fruitex B® OsteoBoron® calcium fructoborate]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">3 mg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellOtherIngredients"" colspan=""2"">Other ingredients: vegetable cellulose (capsule), stearic acid, maltodextrin, ascorbyl palmitate, silica, rice flour, food starch-modified, citric acid.</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n</tbody> \n \n</table> \n \n<p class=""small"">Fruitex B® and OsteoBoron® are registered trademarks of VDF Futureceuticals, Inc.

However, we now know the health risks of eating too much salt, so health-conscious people may miss out on an easy source of iodine. Vitamins D and K with Sea-Iodine™ delivers 1,000 mcg of iodine to support healthy iodine levels. \n \n \n \n<strong>Vitamin K1 and two different types of K2</strong> \n \n \n \nVitamin K helps inhibit calcium buildup in your arteries while promoting healthy calcium absorption into your bone matrix.<sup>3</sup> K1 is the most common form of vitamin K in the diet, coming primarily from leafy green vegetables—though vitamin K1 isn’t well absorbed from these foods. \n \n \n \nVitamin K2 is found in cheese, eggs and fermented soybeans. It has been shown to be more bioavailable than K1 and to remain active in the body far longer. The MK-4 and MK-7 forms of vitamin K2 also provide important benefits but have different tissue distributions and bioavailability, so it’s important to take both.<sup>4,5</sup> This formula contains both forms of vitamin K2. \n \n \n \n<strong>Vitamin D3 for cognitive, bone and immune health</strong> \n \n \n \nHealthy serum vitamin D levels have been shown to correspond with better cognitive function.<sup>6,7</sup> Vitamin D, along with vitamin K and essential minerals, is necessary for facilitating the transport of calcium into the bone matrix for strong, healthy bones and teeth.<sup>8</sup> Vitamin D also plays a critical role in healthy immune function.<sup>9</sup> \n \n \n \nSome people may need 125 mcg (5,000 IU) to 200 mcg (8,000 IU) of vitamin D3 a day to achieve healthy blood levels of vitamin D. If your multivitamin already delivers 25-75 mcg (1,000–3,000 IU) of vitamin D, adding Vitamins D and K with Sea-Iodine™ may help achieve healthy vitamin D levels. \n \n \n \n<strong>Vitamin D3 for heart health and blood pressure support</strong> \n \n \n \nVitamin D promotes a healthy inflammatory response, supports cardiovascular health and encourages healthy endothelial function. Vitamin D also helps inhibit excess renin levels. Healthy renin levels help maintain healthy blood pressure already within the normal range.<sup>10</sup> \n \n \n \n<strong>Getting enough vitamins D and K and iodine</strong> \n \n \n \nThis vitamin D3 supplement delivers 125 mcg (5,000 IU) of vitamin D3 as cholecalciferol per capsule. We suggest that you take a 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood test after 3 months to assess and adjust your dosage. Your optimal blood levels should be 50–80 ng/ml year-round. \n \n \n \nEnsure you get enough of these three essential nutrients with Vitamins D and K with Sea-Iodine™. \n \n<div id=""supplementfacts"" class=""navigationAnchorTitle navigation-anchor-title""> \n \n<h2 class=""section-header"">Supplement Facts</h2> \n \n</div> \n \n<div class=""productSupplementFacts product-supplement-facts mb-2""> \n \n<div id=""tabs-supplement_facts""> \n \n<table> \n \n<tbody> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td> \n \n<table class=""wwwProdLDTableIngredients"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0""> \n \n<tbody> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td colspan=""2"">Serving Size 1 capsule</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellAmountPerServing"" colspan=""2""><span class=""wwwProdLDTextAmountPerServing"">Amount Per Serving</span></td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Vitamin D3 (as cholecalciferol)</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"" width=""20%"">125 mcg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientB"">Vitamin K activity from:</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientB"" align=""right"">2100 mcg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientSubB"">Vitamin K1 (as phytonadione)</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientB"" align=""right"">1000 mcg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientSubB"">Vitamin K2 (as menaquinone-4)</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientB"" align=""right"">1000 mcg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientSubA"">Vitamin K2 (as <em>trans</em> menaquinone-7)</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">100 mcg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"">Iodine [from Sea-Iodine™ Complex Blend (organic kelp and bladderwrack extracts, potassium iodide)]</td> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellIngredientA"" align=""right"">1000 mcg</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDCellOtherIngredients"" colspan=""2"">Other ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, vegetable cellulose (capsule), maltodextrin, food starch-modified, dicalcium phosphate, stearic acid, silica.</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n</tbody> \n \n</table> \n \nNon-GMO \n \n \n \n&nbsp;</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDTitleSections"">Dosage and Use</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td> \n \n<ul> \n \n 	<li>Take one (1) capsule once daily with food, or as recomended by a healthcare practitioner.</li> \n \n</ul> \n \n</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td class=""wwwProdLDTitleSections"">Caution</td> \n \n</tr> \n \n<tr> \n \n<td>Individuals consuming more than 50 mcg (2,000 IU)/day of vitamin D (from diet and supplements) should periodically obtain a serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D measurement.
