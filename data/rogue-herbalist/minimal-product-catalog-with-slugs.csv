1111,Four Mushroom Immune Complex 2oz.,"This blend of wildcrafted mushrooms is one of my award winning herbal formulas. It combines Chaga, Birch Polypore, Chicken of the Woods, and Turkey Tail. These mushrooms are wildcrafted in the woods of Vermont and New Hampshire. They are slow decocted in reverse osmosis maple tree water, before blending with organic cane alcohol and allowing to macerate for a month. This process extracts both the water soluble and alcohol soluble constituents.
\n
\nChaga mushrooms are a type of medicinal mushroom native to colder climates, like the Acadian forests in which we find ourselves. They are often consumed as a supplement due to their high concentration of antioxidants and other beneficial compounds. Some potential health benefits of Chaga includes immune system support, anti-inflammatory effects, and blood sugar control.
\n
\nBirch polypore mushrooms are a type of medicinal mushroom that also grow on birch trees. They are commonly used in traditional medicine and are thought to have immune-boosting and antiviral properties. Some research suggests that birch polypore mushrooms may have potential as a natural treatment for infections and chronic inflammation.
\n
\nChicken of the Woods mushrooms are a type of edible mushroom that gets its name from its poultry-like flavor. In addition to being a tasty addition to dishes, chicken of the woods mushrooms are also believed to have medicinal properties. Some research suggests that they may have anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting effects.
\n
\nTurkey tail mushrooms are a type of medicinal mushroom native to East Asia. They are commonly used in traditional medicine and are thought to have immune-boosting, antiviral, and anti-tumor properties. Some research suggests that turkey tail mushrooms may be helpful in the treatment of various conditions.
\n
\nAll of these mushrooms are decocted (simmered, cooked in our reverse osmosis maple tree water) and then tinctured with organic cane alcohol. This blend is then allowed to macerate for a month or longer before pressing and bottling.

It is important to understand that the underlying science behind the conversion of certain cannabinoids to other related cannabinoids when consumed is not yet fully understood.

\n<em>Rhodiola rosea</em>
\n
\nRhodiola is a powerful adaptogen that has been studied for its ability to make us better able to deal with stress. It has a long history of use in Siberia, Scandinavia, and Tibet to promote energy and protect against respiratory disorders; also used today to improve immunity, enhance exercise and protect the heart against stress-induced damage. It is well known to improve athletic performance and focus. As far as adaptogens go, it is more on the stimulating side, so I prefer to reserve it for times of need when I know I will be doing intense physical labor or exercise, or if I need to focus intensely on a project. This tincture is standardized to a minimum 3% rosavins. Serving size: 30 Drops (1ml) Suggested Use: 30 Drops in water or juice, 1 - 3 times daily, or as needed.

\n<em>Artemisia vulgaris</em>

\nMugwort is an aromatic shrub that has a bittersweet flavor and exerts a calming effect on the nervous system.

Mugwort is a strong emmenagogue and can be used to induce menses, therefore it should not be taken while pregnant. Mugwort is the herb that is used to make Moxa, for the practice of Moxabustion, which is the burning of the plant material and using the heat on parts of the body. This technique is often applied in combination with acupuncture. Also consider trying our <a href=""https://rogueherbalist.com/product/mugwort-tincture-2oz/"">Mugwort Tincture</a>.

It contains a scientifically formulated blend of digestive enzymes, as well as a beneficial probiotic strain to help maintain healthy GI balance.

These digestive enzymes work in a variety of pH conditions. This is important, because different parts of your gastrointestinal tract (stomach, intestines, etc.) have different pH levels—which can also affect digestion.

\n<em>Monotropa uniflora</em>
\n
\nGhost Pipe is truly a ""plant spirit medicine"" if there ever was one. Also known as 'Indian Pipe' or the older name 'Fit Root' (as in epileptic fits), this plant has the unique ability of helping us step outside of our pain, whether that pain is physical, emotional, or spiritual. In the 1939 classic book <em>Back to Eden</em>, Jethro Kloss writes about <em>Monotropa uniflora. </em>He describes it as antispasmodic, nervine, tonic, sedative, and febrifuge. According to Kloss: ""Is splendid in all kinds of fevers. Takes the place of quinine and opium. An excellent remedy for restlessness, fainting, nervous irritability, muscle spasm, and convulsions. Should be used in place of opium and quinine. It will cure intermittent and remittent fevers. Oh, why will not people use this wonderful remedy in place of poisonous drugs? It is efficient and harmless. A teaspoonful of fit root and fennel seed, steeped in a pint of boiling water for twenty minutes, is an excellent douche for inflammation of the vagina and uterus, also good used as a wash for sore eyes. A valuable remedy for epilepsy and lockjaw in children"". (pp. 128)
\n
\nThe modern term is ""Antinociceptive"" is derived from nociception; the perception of pain. It does not dull pain like a common analgesic, but rather it allows us to step outside of our pain and not be consumed by it. Contemporary herbalists tend to use it more for PTSD and trauma induced ailments.
\n
\nThe tincture that I make is small batch and only made once a year. I only harvest the aerial portions of the flowering plant and tincture them fresh at a 1:1 herb to menstruum ratio in a blend of organic cane alcohol and reverse osmosis maple tree water. Start with low dose on this plant, a few drops goes a long way. Take up to a dropperful at a time as needed.

\n
\nThese little berries are full of carotenoids (Vitamin A) which is one reason they are extremely good for the eyes, as well as the heart, kidneys, and the liver. One nickname for this plant is ""Matrimony Vine"" because it is also considered to be good for the libido, and indeed modern research shows this to be the case.

It is indicated for weak lungs, digestion, liver and immune system. It helps the body hold onto moisture and therefore it is an ideal herb for night sweats. This is one of my favorite herbs. It also is a delicious and <a href=""https://rogueherbalist.com/product/ashwagandha-liquid-extract-1oz/"">fast acting tincture</a>.

\n
\nOptimized Tryptophan Plus provides 1,000 mg of high-quality L-tryptophan per serving to promote a healthy mood, help support optimal sleep and support a healthy stress response. Many people prefer using tryptophan combined with its essential cofactors lysine and niacinamide in lieu of 5-HTP. Tryptophan is better able to remain stable in the blood and cross the blood-brain barrier, where it is converted to serotonin. If 5-HTP converts to serotonin in the blood, this serotonin will not cross the blood-brain barrier. Do not combine with pharmaceutical SSRI's or MAOI's.

\n
\nComfrey gets a bad name for a particular constituent known as Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), but this constituent is found in other plants as well and is really only harmful in super high doses. These alkaloids are more potent in the roots, but are also present in Comfrey Leaf. While some studies have suggested that the PAs in comfrey may be harmful, others have found that the herb is safe when used in small amounts and for short periods of time. While it is recommended that Comfrey only be used topically, this is a matter of great debate among herbalists. The dried herb can be used in poultices for sore muscles, broken bones, stiff joints, and other musculoskeletal complaints. We also have a <a href=""https://rogueherbalist.com/product/comfrey-extract-1oz-topical/"">Comfrey Liniment</a> for topical use.

They provide a beautiful ground cover as well as nourishment for the pollinators. However, be aware that certain types of Comfrey are fast spreading and could take over your garden if you let it.

\n<em>Taraxacum offinale</em>
\n
\nRoasted dandelion root has a long history of being used as a coffee substitute, particularly during times of economic hardship or coffee shortages. Dandelion root has a similar appearance and texture to coffee beans and when roasted, it develops a similar flavor profile. During World War II, for example, coffee was rationed and dandelion root was often used as an alternative. The practice of using dandelion root as a coffee substitute dates back even further, with some sources claiming that it was used during the American Civil War and in the Great Depression.
\n
\nDandelion root coffee is made by harvesting the roots of the dandelion plant, washing and drying them, roasting them until they are dark brown and then grounding them. The resulting powder can be used to brew a beverage that is said to have a similar taste to coffee. Some people claim that dandelion root coffee is less bitter and has a slightly sweeter taste than traditional coffee. Dandelion is high in antioxidants, minerals and inulin, a type of soluble fiber.

With roots dating back hundreds of years, horseradish has a rich history of being utilized in traditional European herbal practices. Our horseradish powder is made from Armoracia rusticana roots and can be added to herbal vinegars, sauces, honeys, and condiments.
\n
\nFreshly grated horseradish is a potent source of mustard oil. The root itself has little to no scent, but when grated, the broken plant cells release enzymes that create its distinct aroma. It's best to use grated horseradish immediately or preserve it in vinegar to retain its flavor. Over time, exposure to air or heat will reduce its pungency, darken its color, and make it bitter, though its beneficial properties will still remain in dried form.

\n<em>Lactuca virosa</em>
\n
\nWild Lettuce is also known as ""Lettuce Opium"" because of the latex that exudes from the cut stems and leaves. This sticky white latex is incredibly bitter (meaning it is beneficial for digestion, among other things) but it is also a good nervine. It is considered anodyne or analgesic, a good pain relieving herb. Don't worry though, this plant is incredibly safe, even for children. It can help calm a spasmodic cough and allow you to get much needed sleep. You can prepare a strong infusion of the leaves or if you are feeling more adventurous you can harvest some from the wild and collect the sticky white latex, allow it to dry and then smoke it like the old days.

\nAs a broad-spectrum cannabinoid extract, in addition to cannabidiol (CBD) and more than 80 other cannabinoids in hemp, Rogue Herbalist products may contain a trace amount of the cannabinoid THC, less than .3%. Much like the consumption of poppy seeds may lead to a positive drug test for opioids, the consumption of certain hemp products may lead to a positive drug test for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is inherently present in trace amounts in hemp plants. The legal limit of THC in hemp is no more than 0.3%. It is important to understand that the underlying science behind the conversion of certain cannabinoids to other related cannabinoids when consumed is not yet fully understood. If you are a person who is subject to drug testing we strongly suggest consulting your health care provider before consuming any hemp products because individual biochemistry, the potential for the conversion of cannabinoids, and the possibility of trace, but legal, amounts of THC inherent in hemp products are all factors to consider.",cbd-hemp-oil

\n<em>Symphytum officinale</em>
\n
\nComfrey gets a bad name for a particular constituent known as Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), but this constituent is found in other plants as well and is really only harmful in super high doses. These alkaloids are more potent in the roots, but are also present in Comfrey Leaf. While some studies have suggested that the PAs in comfrey may be harmful, others have found that the herb is safe when used in small amounts and for short periods of time. While it is recommended that Comfrey only be used topically, this is a matter of great debate among herbalists. The dried herb can be used in poultices for sore muscles, broken bones, stiff joints, and other musculoskeletal complaints. We also carry <a href=""https://rogueherbalist.com/product/comfrey-root-organic-1oz-bag/"">Comfrey Root</a> in bulk.
\n
\nWe plant Comfrey in our herb garden around the edges of the porch and building. It is a wonderful plant in permaculture as it helps to pull up minerals from the soil and then the leaves can be used as a “green manure”. They provide a beautiful ground cover as well as nourishment for the pollinators. However, be aware that certain types of Comfrey are fast spreading and could take over your garden if you let it.

It is indeed a powerful nervine but is also antiviral, anti-inflammatory, astringent, antibacterial, vulnerary, sedative, hepatoprotective (liver protective), and more.

\nAs a broad-spectrum cannabinoid extract, in addition to cannabidiol (CBD) and more than 80 other cannabinoids in hemp, Rogue Herbalist products may contain a trace amount of the cannabinoid THC, less than .3%. Much like the consumption of poppy seeds may lead to a positive drug test for opioids, the consumption of certain hemp products may lead to a positive drug test for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is inherently present in trace amounts in hemp plants. The legal limit of THC in hemp is no more than 0.3%. It is important to understand that the underlying science behind the conversion of certain cannabinoids to other related cannabinoids when consumed is not yet fully understood. If you are a person who is subject to drug testing we strongly suggest consulting your health care provider before consuming any hemp products because individual biochemistry, the potential for the conversion of cannabinoids, and the possibility of trace, but legal, amounts of THC inherent in hemp products are all factors to consider.","CBD Stress Adapt

\n
\nEidon's multiple minerals are a complement of all essential and trace minerals necessary for good health in a silica base. In any multiple mineral formulae, the key to its successful formulation lies in its mineral balance. Minerals work in a precise balance or ratio to one another. Too much or too little of even a trace mineral can decrease the effectiveness of a formula by limiting the availability of the other minerals. For people with well-balanced mineral ratios or those looking for a basic formula to supply a well-balanced broad spectrum of the most important mineral nutrients, Eidon's multiple mineral formulae can be an excellent addition to your nutritional program. Eidon's formulation reflects the most current understanding of optimal balance in a mineral formula. The macro minerals, calcium, and magnesium are kept in a 1:1 ratio to correct the erroneous dietary trend of high calcium and low magnesium intake. Easy on the stomach. Safe for all ages no color or scent.

In any multiple mineral formulae, the key to its successful formulation lies in its mineral balance. Minerals work in a precise balance or ratio to one another. Too much or too little of even a trace mineral can decrease the effectiveness of a formula by limiting the availability of the other minerals. For people with well-balanced mineral ratios or those looking for a basic formula to supply a well-balanced broad spectrum of the most important mineral nutrients, Eidon's multiple mineral formulae can be an excellent addition to your nutritional program. Eidon's formulation reflects the most current understanding of optimal balance in a mineral formula. The macro minerals, calcium, and magnesium are kept in a 1:1 ratio to correct the erroneous dietary trend of high calcium and low magnesium intake. Easy on the stomach. Safe for all ages no color or scent.",eidon-multiple-mineral-2oz

\nZinc promotes immune system health by activating the production of white blood cells. Zinc also activates the production of numerous compounds necessary for growth and development.

\n
\nPotassium is one of seven inorganic, macro mineral nutrients needed in relatively high daily amounts. It is the third most prevalent element in the body after Calcium. Along with Chloride, Sodium, Magnesium and Calcium, Potassium is an essential electrolyte. These elements are called electrolytes because they carry an electrical charge when dissolved in body fluids. Electrolytes help regulate nerve transmission and many cell membrane functions. Magnesium helps maintain the Potassium in the cells; but even more crucial is the proper Sodium to Potassium balance. Without Potassium, cell function will be impacted. Potassium works with Sodium to regulate blood pressure, transmit nerve impulses, and maintain cellular wall permeability. Along with Magnesium, it is essential for the proper functioning of the heart muscle. In this role, Potassium acts as the catalyst stimulating cellular contraction. Potassium has many functions but most important are: regulating intracellular fluids, aids in the regulation of the body's water balance, facilitating nerve impulses, transmission of electrical signals between nerves and cells, contracting muscle tissue, balancing the acid/alkaline system.

Mango butter has natural emollient properties; it has traditionally been used in the rain forest and tropics for its moisturizing and smoothing properties. It is a great source of essential fatty acids, and has beneficial moisturizing properties for lotions and acts as a mild lubricant for the skin.</span>
\n
\n<span style=""font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: medium;"">To prolong its shelf life, store in a dark, cool location. Mango is a relatively hard butter and does not apply well as a “stand alone” application; however it will disperse evenly onto the skin once liquefied and warmed. It is best used within cosmetic formulations or added with other ingredients to make it more pliable.</span>

\n
\nBased on a 350-year old Chinese herbal formula for “drunkenness”, Kudzu Recovery provides a blend of kudzu roots in conjunction with key botanicals including coptis, codonopsis, and ginger, which support liver health, the nervous system, and detoxification processes. This gives the benefits of kudzu while supporting other systems necessary for the healthful management of alcohol intake.

7479,Beet Essence Juice Powder 5.3oz,"Organic Beet Essence Juice Powder 5.3oz
\n
\nOrganic Beet Essence Juice Powder May Help:
\n
\n<strong>• Fight Off Free Radicals:</strong> Beets are a fantastic source of antioxidants, in particular vitamin C, manganese and two carotenoids called lutein and zeaxanthin.
\n
\n<strong>• Reduce Inflammation: </strong>Pigments in beets may help reduce inflammation, consequently reducing risk factors for developing everything from heart diseases to cancer. The same pigments may also reduce pain associated with osteoarthritis.
\n
\n<strong>• Protect Vision:</strong> Studies have found a link between consuming lutein and zeaxanthin and lowering risk factors for age-related macular degeneration, and it may also help prevent cataracts and retinitis pigmentosa.
\n
\n<strong>• Lower Blood Pressure:</strong> Beets can help lower blood pressure, likely due to the high level of nitrates naturally present in the vegetable. Results appear to be short-lived, but long-term change is possible with regular consumption.
\n
\n<strong>• Improve Energy Levels and Physical Performance:</strong> Nitrates have also been linked to mitochondrial efficiency. Consuming beet juice on a daily basis may help athletes increase their oxygen use, improve performance and boost endurance.
\n
\n<strong>• Prevent Cognitive Decline: </strong>Nitrates once again come into play here by increasing the dilation of blood vessels and promoting blood flow to the brain, especially the frontal lobe, which controls memory and decision-making.
\n
\n<strong>• Cleanse the Liver:</strong> Beets contain an amino acid called betaine that may assist in reducing the amount of fat that accumulates in the liver, improving function and helping the liver stay a healthy size.
\n
\n<strong>• Support Detoxification:</strong> As toxins build up, our bodies have to work overtime to clear the debris and accomplish routine tasks. Betalain from beets has been shown to trigger the phase of detox that neutralizes and disposes of those toxins.
\n
\nGreen Foods Beet Essence is most effective when taken on an empty stomach, preferably either 20 minutes before or 2 hours after a meal. Simply stir a single serving (5 grams, or about one teaspoon) of the powder into 6-8 ounces of your favorite cold liquid. Beet Essence is delicious when mixed with water, or you can add it to your favorite fresh juice or smoothie.
\n
\nUse Beet Essence as a daily complement to your plant-based or omnivore diet, or treat yourself to a healthy boost on those afternoons when you feel your energy flagging.
\n
\nOur Beet Essence only has two ingredients: organic beet juice powder and organic maltodextrin (derived from tapioca). The powder contains no added salt, sugar, coloring, fillers, animal products, soy, wheat, gluten, corn, yeast or GMOs.

\nAs a broad-spectrum cannabinoid extract, in addition to cannabidiol (CBD) and more than 80 other cannabinoids in hemp, Rogue Herbalist products may contain a trace amount of the cannabinoid THC, less than .3%. Much like the consumption of poppy seeds may lead to a positive drug test for opioids, the consumption of certain hemp products may lead to a positive drug test for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

It is important to understand that the underlying science behind the conversion of certain cannabinoids to other related cannabinoids when consumed is not yet fully understood.

\nRoasted dandelion root has a long history of being used as a coffee substitute, particularly during times of economic hardship or coffee shortages. Dandelion root has a similar appearance and texture to coffee beans and when roasted, it develops a similar flavor profile.

The practice of using dandelion root as a coffee substitute dates back even further, with some sources claiming that it was used during the American Civil War and in the Great Depression.

The resulting powder can be used to brew a beverage that is said to have a similar taste to coffee. Some people claim that dandelion root coffee is less bitter and has a slightly sweeter taste than traditional coffee. Dandelion is high in antioxidants, minerals and inulin, a type of soluble fiber.

Due to its fiber content, it has been traditionally used to feed beneficial probiotics in the gut, for IBS like symptoms, to enhance fullness and regulate cholesterol.

\nSolomon’s Seal is truly a remarkable remedy for the muscular and skeletal system. I have personally used it to heal my injured back and given it to many clients with success. According to Matthew Wood: “It is suited to a wide range of problems affecting the joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. It tightens or loosens tendons and attachments (depending on which is needed), strengthens and repairs joint damage, soothes…many kinds of arthritis in the joints, and works nicely with repetitive-injury problems such as tennis elbow, jogger’s knee, and carpal-tunnel syndrome”(The Practice of Traditional Western Herbalism pp. 191). These granules particularly make a nice oil or salve to rub on aches and pain.

\n
\nTart cherries are known by several names, including dwarf cherries or sour cherries, but don’t start puckering just yet—they’ve got a sweet kick to them, too, making for the perfect flavor balance. But that’s just the surface level of what makes this concentrate great. Inside each bottle you’ll find vitamins A, C and K, along with minerals and nutrients such as copper, manganese and potassium. And if you need to chill out, tart cherries can help you dial it down a notch thanks to naturally-occurring melatonin, and the compounds tryptophan and anthocyanins, which encourage your body to create melatonin. Tart cherries also offer five times the antioxidants of sweet cherries, but our concentrate takes that antioxidant profile even further by packing the antioxidant power of 1000* tart cherries in each 32-oz bottle. That’s a lot of goodness loaded into one concentrate! Traditionally used for relief from inflammation and gout.
\n
\nUntainted by sweeteners, preservatives, and other additives, Dynamic Health Certified Organic Tart Cherry Juice is nothing more than pure, natural power and nutrition. Extracted from sun-ripened montmorency and balaton tart cherries, our 100% juice concentrate contains the antioxidant power of 1000* tart cherries in each 32-oz bottle along with naturally occurring nutrients.
\n
\nPerfectly tasty on its own or mixed with seltzer, smoothies, sauces, dressings, and vinaigrettes, it's easy to take a serving each day. And because our Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate is certified organic, gluten free, vegan, BPA free, Halal, and Kosher, there's no reason not to!
\n
\nTrust one of nature's most powerful elixirs to deliver extraordinary taste and nutrition.
\n
\n100% Tart Cherry Concentrate - Nothing else added! No added sugar. Kosher.

7874,Eidon Selenium Liquid Concentrate 2 oz,"Eidon Selenium Liquid Concentrate 2 oz
\n<p class=""p1"">Eidon’s Ionic Liquid Selenium supports a healthy immune system, thyroid and liver function, and breast and prostate tissues. Selenium is involved as a catalyst in several important enzymes. The most well-known function is in the liver where selenium catalyzes or activates the glutathione peroxidase enzyme. This enzyme plays its most significant role in the liver as it cleanses the blood. Without it, the liver could not do its job properly leaving our system full of toxins.</p>
\nSelenium plays an important role in the thyroid where, along with Iodine, it catalyzes the T4 and T3 enzymes which are critical for energy production. Along with the thyroid, Selenium is also found in sizable amounts in healthy breast and prostate tissues.
\n

\n<p class=""p1"">Eidon’s Ionic Liquid Selenium supports a healthy immune system, thyroid and liver function, and breast and prostate tissues. Selenium is involved as a catalyst in several important enzymes. The most well-known function is in the liver where selenium catalyzes or activates the glutathione peroxidase enzyme. This enzyme plays its most significant role in the liver as it cleanses the blood. Without it, the liver could not do its job properly leaving our system full of toxins.</p>
\nSelenium plays an important role in the thyroid where, along with Iodine, it catalyzes the T4 and T3 enzymes which are critical for energy production. Along with the thyroid, Selenium is also found in sizable amounts in healthy breast and prostate tissues.

\n
\nMatcha is a powerful form of green tea. It contains nutrients from the entire tea leaf, giving it more caffeine and antioxidants than typically found in green tea. Matcha is also known for its bold green hue and delicious, mildly sweet and nutty flavor. The flavor is particularly vegetal, with some notes of bitterness in addition to the sweetness. This is a healthy tea that will give you consistent, calm energy. It is filled with antioxidants and vitamins.
\n
\nTo brew: bring water to about 175 degrees, not quite boiling. Use about 1 teaspoon for about ¼ cup of water. Sift the powder into a bowl and add water. Use a bamboo or small kitchen whisk to incorporate into a frothy brew or add sifted powder and water to a mason jar and shake. Matcha is a strong, concentrated cup of tea because the entire leaf is ground into a powder and whisked into a tea. You can dilute with milk for a latte and also add sweetener to taste.
\n
\nSold in 1oz. quantities. If you want multiple ounces, just add multiple quantities.

\nD-glucarate can be found naturally in many foods. Fruits like grapefruits, apples and oranges, as well as cruciferous vegetables, contain D-glucarate. Calcium D-glucarate is also made in the body. D-glucarate helps support effective and healthy detoxification.
\n
\nCalcium D-glucarate is the calcium salt of D-glucarate, a compound made in the body through the oxidation of glucose. D-glucarate is also found naturally in grapefruit, apples, oranges and cruciferous vegetables.<sup>1,2</sup> D-glucarate can be converted into another compound that helps the body clear steroid hormones and various toxins through a detoxification process called glucuronidation.
\n<div id=""detailsCollapse"" class=""collapse"" aria-hidden=""false"" aria-expanded=""true"">
\n
\nThis active D-glucarate metabolite works by inhibiting an enzyme that reverses glucuronidation. By supporting effective detoxification, D-glucarate helps maintain optimal hormone levels and promote clearance.<sup>1-3</sup> It also encourages a healthy inflammatory response and offers antioxidant protection.<sup>4-6</sup>
\n
\nCalcium D-glucarate has been shown to support normal cell division in laboratory studies.<sup>7-9</sup> In addition, D-glucarate has been found to help maintain already-healthy levels of cholesterol and other lipids.<sup>2</sup>

\nJiaogulan is a powerful adaptogenic herb sourced from the small farming communities in Northern Thailand. With its sweet taste and numerous health benefits, it’s no wonder that Jiaogulan is often referred to as “The Herb of Immortality”.
\n
\nJiaogulan contains a class of compounds called gypenosides that are responsible for its impressive health benefits. These compounds are structurally similar to the ginsenosides found in Panax ginseng, which is another plant commonly used in traditional medicine. With over 80 gypenosides identified in Jiaogulan, it has more medicinal saponins than Panax ginseng, and is believed to have a variety of beneficial effects on the body.
\n
\nResearch suggests that ginsenosides may help improve cardiovascular health, lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease, and have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. They have also been studied for their potential to improve cognitive function, enhance immune function, and have anti-cancer effects.

\n<h2 class=""roboto"">Vitamin K2 and bone density</h2>
\nYour body has a built-in process for maintaining healthy bone structure, but this process begins to decline over time. In clinical studies, a special form of vitamin K2 called menaquinone-4 (or just MK-4 for short) has been shown to support the biological processes that help maintain bone mineral density in populations that need it most, such as postmenopausal women.

\n</div>
\n<div class=""productDetails product-details mb-3 mb-md-4"">
\n
\n<strong>Calcium</strong>
\n
\nBone Restore provides a total of 700 mg of four types of easily absorbed calcium: calcium carbonate, calcium citrate malate, calcium bisglycinate chelate, and calcium fructoborate—all delivered in a capsule designed to facilitate calcium breakdown during digestion.
\n<div id=""detailsCollapse"" class=""collapse"" aria-hidden=""false"" aria-expanded=""true"">
\n
\n<strong>Vitamin D3</strong>
\n
\nVitamin D is essential for absorbing calcium from the digestive tract into the bloodstream, thus it is vital for helping maintain strong, healthy bones and teeth.<sup>1,2</sup>
\n
\n<strong>Vitamin K is necessary for healthy bone mineral density</strong>
\n
\nBone loss occurs over time and is a result of an imbalance in the activity of bone cells where there is an increased activity in the bone-dissolving cells called osteoclasts as well as a corresponding decrease in the activity of bone-forming cells, or osteoblasts.<sup>3</sup>
\n
\nVitamin K has been shown to be essential for bone mineralization because it’s a cofactor for the carboxylation of osteocalcin, a protein produced by osteoblasts that is responsible for binding calcium and depositing in the bone. This process is called <em>bone mineralization</em>.<sup>4,5</sup>
\n
\n<strong>Getting enough vitamin K2</strong>
\n
\nIf you’re not getting enough vitamin K2, osteocalcin doesn’t undergo carboxylation and remains in its inactive form, which means it cannot bind to calcium and play its role in bone formation.<sup>5</sup>
\n
\n<strong>Magnesium</strong>
\n
\nMagnesium is needed to maintain strong bones and a healthy vascular system.<sup>6</sup> Bone Restore contains 300 mg of magnesium from magnesium oxide.
\n
\n<strong>Other bone healthy nutrients</strong>
\n
\nLike other formulas in our Bone Restore family, Bone Restore Elite also delivers healthy doses of the trace minerals your bones need:
\n
\n<strong>Zinc, manganese and silicon</strong> are essential for healthy bone maintenance. Bone maintenance is the healthy balance between bone mineral resorption and remodeling.<sup>7-10</sup> You have to have sufficient intake of these elements to support healthy bone formation.
\n
\n<strong>Boron</strong> is a trace mineral with beneficial effects for bone and joint strength.<sup>9,11</sup> This formula contains patented Fruitex B® OsteoBoron®, made from a novel calcium/carbohydrate/boron complex.

\nThe silk tree, also known as the mimosa tree, is commonly referred to as ‘happiness tree’ in Traditional Chinese Medicine due to its nervine properties and promotion of positive emotional state. The bark can be used in the form of a tea or tincture and can also be powered to make capsules or external pastes. Mimosa is known for its uplifting qualities and can be supportive in times of immense grief, depression, or despair. Consuming the tincture or tea before bed can soothe the nerves to promote a night of sound sleep. Traditionally it has also been used to support someone processing grief or loss and is often combined with Hawthorn for this purpose.

\n
\nIodine is a trace element essential for the production of thyroid hormones, and vitamin K is an essential nutrient that promotes both arterial and bone health.
\n
\n<strong>Iodine is essential for thyroid health</strong>
\n
\nIodine is a trace element necessary for the production of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).<sup>1</sup> Iodine is abundant in seafood and sea vegetables, but not everyone likes or has access to marine foods, and vegan diets sometimes lack adequate iodine.<sup>2</sup>
\n
\nCommercial salt makers add iodine to table salt to make up for this potential deficiency. However, we now know the health risks of eating too much salt, so health-conscious people may miss out on an easy source of iodine. Vitamins D and K with Sea-Iodine™ delivers 1,000 mcg of iodine to support healthy iodine levels.
\n
\n<strong>Vitamin K1 and two different types of K2</strong>
\n
\nVitamin K helps inhibit calcium buildup in your arteries while promoting healthy calcium absorption into your bone matrix.<sup>3</sup> K1 is the most common form of vitamin K in the diet, coming primarily from leafy green vegetables—though vitamin K1 isn’t well absorbed from these foods.
\n
\nVitamin K2 is found in cheese, eggs and fermented soybeans. It has been shown to be more bioavailable than K1 and to remain active in the body far longer. The MK-4 and MK-7 forms of vitamin K2 also provide important benefits but have different tissue distributions and bioavailability, so it’s important to take both.<sup>4,5</sup> This formula contains both forms of vitamin K2.
\n
\n<strong>Vitamin D3 for cognitive, bone and immune health</strong>
\n
\nHealthy serum vitamin D levels have been shown to correspond with better cognitive function.<sup>6,7</sup> Vitamin D, along with vitamin K and essential minerals, is necessary for facilitating the transport of calcium into the bone matrix for strong, healthy bones and teeth.<sup>8</sup> Vitamin D also plays a critical role in healthy immune function.<sup>9</sup>
\n
\nSome people may need 125 mcg (5,000 IU) to 200 mcg (8,000 IU) of vitamin D3 a day to achieve healthy blood levels of vitamin D. If your multivitamin already delivers 25-75 mcg (1,000–3,000 IU) of vitamin D, adding Vitamins D and K with Sea-Iodine™ may help achieve healthy vitamin D levels.
\n
\n<strong>Vitamin D3 for heart health and blood pressure support</strong>
\n
\nVitamin D promotes a healthy inflammatory response, supports cardiovascular health and encourages healthy endothelial function. Vitamin D also helps inhibit excess renin levels. Healthy renin levels help maintain healthy blood pressure already within the normal range.<sup>10</sup>
\n
\n<strong>Getting enough vitamins D and K and iodine</strong>
\n
\nThis vitamin D3 supplement delivers 125 mcg (5,000 IU) of vitamin D3 as cholecalciferol per capsule. We suggest that you take a 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood test after 3 months to assess and adjust your dosage. Your optimal blood levels should be 50–80 ng/ml year-round.
\n
\nEnsure you get enough of these three essential nutrients with Vitamins D and K with Sea-Iodine™.

\n<p data-start=""500"" data-end=""904"">Methylene blue is a long-established compound. It was first synthesized in the 19th century and historically used as a dye and in treating malaria. Today, it holds FDA-approval for treating methemoglobinemia. This is a rare condition where red blood cells struggle to release oxygen effectively.</p>
\n<p data-start=""500"" data-end=""904"">Beyond this, early research—particularly in animal studies and small human trials—suggests that low-dose methylene blue may support mitochondrial function. It does this by enhancing cellular energy (ATP) production and reducing oxidative stress. It is also being explored for its potential neuroprotective and cognitive-supportive properties. These applications are in conditions like Alzheimer’s.</p>
\n<p data-start=""500"" data-end=""904"">However, experts caution that current evidence remains limited. Combining methylene blue with certain medications—especially antidepressants—can pose significant risks, including serotonin syndrome.</p>
