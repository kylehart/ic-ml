## Quick Deploy (5 Steps)

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your keys:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# - RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
# - RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev  (testing) or no-reply@instruction.coach (production)
```

### 2. Test Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start server
uvicorn src.web_service:app --reload --port 8000

# Visit: http://localhost:8000/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", ...}
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Option A: Via Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to railway.app
2. "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub"
3. Select ic-ml repository
4. Add environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, RESEND_API_KEY, RESEND_FROM_EMAIL)
5. Deploy (automatic from Dockerfile)

# Option B: Via Railway CLI
railway login
railway link
railway up
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
railway variables set RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
railway variables set RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev  # Testing; use no-reply@instruction.coach for production
```

Your app will be live at: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

3. Configure ending card:
   - Type: Redirect to URL
   - URL: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/results`

### 5. Test End-to-End

1. Submit test form with your real email
2. Check Railway logs for processing

## Key Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/health` | GET | Health check (Railway uses this) |
| `/api/v1/webhook/formbricks` | POST | Receives Formbricks submissions |
| `/results` | GET | Email lookup page (HTML) |
| `/api/v1/results/lookup` | POST | Fetch results by email (JSON) |

---

## Environment Variables

### Required

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                     # Or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...                     # For email delivery
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev   # Testing: onboarding@resend.dev
                                           # Production: no-reply@instruction.coach
```

### Optional

```bash
PORT=8000                    # Railway provides this automatically
ENVIRONMENT=production       # Logging mode
```

---

## Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard

- **Logs:** View real-time processing logs
- **Metrics:** CPU, memory, request count
- **Deployments:** History and rollback options

### Look for these log messages:

```
âœ… "Received Formbricks webhook: responseFinished"
âœ… "Queued health quiz processing for user@example.com"
âœ… "Email sent successfully to user@example.com"
âœ… "Successfully processed health quiz for user@example.com"
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Webhook not firing | Check Formbricks webhook URL and trigger settings |
| Email not sending | Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set in Railway variables |
| Results "processing" forever | Check Railway logs for LLM API errors |
| Results not found | Use exact same email, check 24hr expiration |

---

## Local Development with Webhooks

Use ngrok to test Formbricks webhooks locally:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local server
uvicorn src.web_service:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Expose with ngrok
ngrok http 8000

# Update Formbricks webhook to ngrok URL:
# https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/v1/webhook/formbricks

# Submit test form â†’ see webhook in real-time!
```

## Cost Breakdown

### Free Tier Limits

- **Railway:** $5/month credit (plenty for MVP)
- **Formbricks:** Unlimited surveys (free tier)
- **Resend:** 3000 emails/month (free tier)
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini:** ~$0.0003 per quiz

### Example Usage

- 100 quizzes/month = $0.03 in LLM costs + Railway compute (within $5 credit)
- 1000 quizzes/month = $0.30 in LLM costs + Railway compute (within $5 credit)

You can run **thousands of quizzes/month** before needing to upgrade!

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Local development
uvicorn src.web_service:app --reload --port 8000

# Test webhook locally with ngrok
ngrok http 8000

# Check Railway logs
railway logs --follow

# Deploy to Railway
git push  # Auto-deploys if connected to GitHub

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health

# Test webhook (manual)
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/v1/webhook/formbricks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event": "responseFinished", "data": {...}}'
```

---

## Success Metrics

Your MVP is working if:

âœ… Formbricks form submits successfully
âœ… Railway receives webhook and logs "Queued health quiz processing"
âœ… User receives email within 10 seconds
âœ… Results page loads and shows recommendations
âœ… Product links work and go to Rogue Herbalist site
âœ… Total processing time < 10 seconds

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors locally

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd /Users/kylehart/Documents/dev/repos/all/ic-ml

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set Python path
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/ic-ml/src:$PYTHONPATH
```

### Railway build fails

- Check Dockerfile syntax
- Verify requirements.txt has all dependencies
- Check Railway build logs for specific error

### Webhook returns 500 error

- Check environment variables are set in Railway
- Check Railway logs for Python errors
- Verify LLM API key is valid
