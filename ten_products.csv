1111,Four Mushroom Immune Complex 2oz.,"This blend of wildcrafted mushrooms is one of my award winning herbal formulas. It combines Chaga, Birch Polypore, Chicken of the Woods, and Turkey Tail. These mushrooms are wildcrafted in the woods of Vermont and New Hampshire. They are slow decocted in reverse osmosis maple tree water, before blending with organic cane alcohol and allowing to macerate for a month. This process extracts both the water soluble and alcohol soluble constituents.\n\nChaga mushrooms are a type of medicinal mushroom native to colder climates, like the Acadian forests in which we find ourselves. They are often consumed as a supplement due to their high concentration of antioxidants and other beneficial compounds. Some potential health benefits of Chaga includes immune system support, anti-inflammatory effects, and blood sugar control.\n\nBirch polypore mushrooms are a type of medicinal mushroom that also grow on birch trees. They are commonly used in traditional medicine and are thought to have immune-boosting and antiviral properties. Some research suggests that birch polypore mushrooms may have potential as a natural treatment for infections and chronic inflammation.\n\nChicken of the Woods mushrooms are a type of edible mushroom that gets its name from its poultry-like flavor. In addition to being a tasty addition to dishes, chicken of the woods mushrooms are also believed to have medicinal properties. Some research suggests that they may have anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting effects.\n\nTurkey tail mushrooms are a type of medicinal mushroom native to East Asia. They are commonly used in traditional medicine and are thought to have immune-boosting, antiviral, and anti-tumor properties. Some research suggests that turkey tail mushrooms may be helpful in the treatment of various conditions.\n\nAll of these mushrooms are decocted (simmered, cooked in our reverse osmosis maple tree water) and then tinctured with organic cane alcohol. This blend is then allowed to macerate for a month or longer before pressing and bottling.\n\nThese statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Much like the consumption of poppy seeds may lead to a positive <span class=""il"">drug</span> <span class=""il"">test</span> for opioids, the consumption of certain hemp products may lead to a positive <span class=""il"">drug</span> <span class=""il"">test</span> for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is inherently present in trace amounts in hemp plants. The legal limit of THC in hemp is no more than 0.3%. It’s important to understand that the underlying science behind the conversion of certain cannabinoids to other related cannabinoids when consumed is not yet fully understood. If you are a person who is subject to <span class=""il"">drug</span> <span class=""il"">testing</span> we strongly suggest consulting your health care provider before consuming any hemp products because individual biochemistry, the potential for the conversion of cannabinoids, and the possibility of trace, but legal, amounts of THC inherent in hemp products are all factors to consider.</div>\n<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>"
